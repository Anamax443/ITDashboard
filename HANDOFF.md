# ITDashboard Handoff

Last updated: 2026-06-03 (perf-events)

## Current Live State

- Project: ITDashboard
- Repo: `https://github.com/Anamax443/ITDashboard`
- Local path: `D:\git\ITDashboard`
- Runtime server: `10.8.2.213` / `B-S-W-MIKOS`
- Runtime path on server: `C:\Apps\ITDashboard`
- SQL server: `10.8.2.225`
- Database: `ITDashboard`
- Live commit: `0925d4d`
- Browser URL: `http://10.8.2.213:4000/`
- Docs URL: `http://10.8.2.213:4000/docs`

## Deployment Model

- Local edit in `D:\git\ITDashboard`
- Commit locally
- Push to `main`
- GitHub Actions self-hosted runner on `10.8.2.213` deploys to `C:\Apps\ITDashboard`
- The workflow mirrors source, installs dependencies, typechecks, builds server + browser UI, applies migrations, then restarts `ITDashboardAPI`.

Important:
- Push to `main` requires explicit operator authorization: `Autorizuj push do main`
- After every commit, report the commit hash in chat.
- Local branch may be `scaffold/initial`; push explicitly with `git push origin HEAD:main`.

## Dashboard UI access (whitelist)

The dashboard UI gate is **frontend-side, not API-side**. When the React app loads on
the browser, `App.tsx` calls `GET /access-check` which returns
`{ ip: req.ip, allowed: bool }`. If `allowed=false`, the app renders
`<AccessDenied ip={...} />` instead of the dashboard layout.

The **JSON API endpoints, the bundle, and `/docs` are not gated** — the server lives on
an internal domain network and is intentionally domain-wide reachable. This is a UX
gate ("you're not on the operator list, here's who to ask"), not a security boundary.
Bypass via DevTools is possible and considered acceptable for the threat model
(incidental UI discovery by non-IT users browsing the LAN). If you need a true API
security boundary, that's a separate feature (auth tokens, mTLS, …).

Source of truth for the whitelist is the Windows Firewall rule "ITDashboard API (4000)".
The server caches the rule contents in memory (`apps/server/src/services/ip-guard.ts`):
loaded at boot via `getAllowedIPs()`, refreshed after every PUT to `/firewall/whitelist`.
Loopback `127.0.0.1` / `::1` is always allowed regardless of cache state so the service
can self-call.

Known operational gotcha: the Windows Firewall rule may be **inert** if the Domain
profile is `Enabled=False` (often set by GPO). Check with:
`Get-NetFirewallProfile | Format-Table Name, Enabled`.
The frontend gate does not depend on the OS firewall being active — it just reads the
rule contents as the whitelist source — so the UI is still gated correctly even with
the OS firewall disabled.

## Runtime Services

- API service: Windows Service `ITDashboardAPI` managed by NSSM
- Runner service: `actions.runner.Anamax443-ITDashboard.B-S-W-MIKOS`
- Service account: `AXINETWORK\svc-itdashboard`
- API port: `4000`
- Firewall rule: `ITDashboard API (4000)`
- API access is controlled by the whitelist in Settings -> Network access.

## Important Windows/Domain Gotchas

- AXINETWORK servers enforce PowerShell `AllSigned` via GPO.
- GitHub Actions workflow must use `shell: cmd`.
- Service restart must use `sc stop` + polling until `STOPPED`, then `sc start`.
- `net stop` alone can race and leave the old Node process in memory.
- SQL uses `msnodesqlv8` for real Windows Integrated Auth. Do not switch to `tedious`.
- GitHub Actions repo variable `SQL_INSTANCE` uses `_` as sentinel for default SQL instance.

## Current Features

- Dashboard tab with summary cards and drill-downs.
- Events tab for Warning/Error/Critical eventlog data.
- Computers tab with AD sync, monitor toggle, exclude toggle, disk status, reachability status, current IP + logged-in user (collected piggyback on disk scan via the same DCOM session).
- Services tab with stopped auto-service detection, policy/drift classification, by-PC and by-service views, GPO script export.
- Perf tab with Diagnostics-Performance event data (slow boot/shutdown/standby/resume) — summary cards, top culprits, most affected PCs, recent events table.
- Activity tab with two modes: **Live** (in-memory ring buffer 500 entries, 2s poll) and **History** (DB-backed, filters: time range / level / source / text search, paginated). Every `logActivity` call is fire-and-forget persisted to `activity_log` table (retention `activity.retention_days`, default 30).
- Settings tab with:
  - Periodic checks frequency
  - Periodic checks day selection: Po, Ut, St, Ct, Pa, So, Ne
  - Periodic checks time window, default `06:00` to `18:00`
  - Check selection: Eventlog collector, Disk scan, Services scan, Perf events
  - Network firewall whitelist
  - Disk thresholds

## Periodic Checks

Implemented in:
- `apps/server/src/services/checks-runner.ts`
- `apps/server/migrations/015_periodic_checks.sql`
- `apps/desktop/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`

Settings keys:
- `checks.interval_sec`
- `checks.days`
- `checks.window_start`
- `checks.window_end`
- `checks.run_eventlog`
- `checks.run_disk`
- `checks.run_services`
- `checks.run_perf`
- `checks.run_adsync` (default `false` in periodic — fleet AD MERGE is overkill every 15 min)
- `adsync.default_monitor_enabled` (default `true`) — applied to newly INSERTed PCs by AD sync. Existing PCs keep their current `monitor_enabled` flag (operator intent persists).
- `perf.cold_start_days` (default `30`) — how far back the perf-events collector reaches on the very first sweep of a PC. Subsequent sweeps go incrementally from the last collected event. Range 1–365.

Behavior:
- Scheduled checks run only inside the selected day/time window.
- Manual `Run all checks` runs even outside the window AND forces every check on, including AD sync — regardless of the `checks.run_*` selection. So clicking "Run all" always refreshes inventory from AD even if periodic AD sync is off.
- The checks runner uses a registry pattern so future checks can be added as new entries rather than new independent schedulers.
- AD sync is registered as the first check in the run order so subsequent collectors see fresh inventory in the same run.

## Verification Commands

```powershell
cd D:\git\ITDashboard
npm run typecheck
npm run build --workspace @itdashboard/server
npm run build --workspace @itdashboard/desktop
```

After deploy:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://10.8.2.213:4000/version
Invoke-WebRequest http://10.8.2.213:4000/ -UseBasicParsing
Invoke-RestMethod http://10.8.2.213:4000/settings
```

Expected:
- `/version` shows the latest pushed commit hash.
- `/` returns `200 text/html`.
- `/settings` contains `checks.*` keys after migration.

## If Deploy Looks Green But UI Is Old

1. Check topbar hash vs latest commit.
2. Check `http://10.8.2.213:4000/version`.
3. If hash is old, service restart likely failed.
4. Check GitHub Actions deploy logs, especially the service restart step.
5. Historical fix is in workflow: `sc stop` + wait for `STOPPED` + `sc start`.

## Backlog Ideas

- Per-PC detail page: timeline, disks, services, perf events, last errors.
- Alerting through Resend email or Teams webhook.
- Setup guide/checklist in UI for GPO and permissions rollout.
- Future checks should plug into the checks registry, not create standalone timers.

## Design notes

- ITDashboard is an **observer, not an executor** — the loop is
  `observe → compare with threshold → show to operator`, never
  `observe → act → re-observe`. Remediation is delegated to the human
  at the screen. The Services tab "GPO script export" follows this rule
  (we export a script, we don't execute it). Future backlog items like
  "Direct fix button per service-PC" would cross that line and should
  be evaluated against this principle before being implemented.
- Absence of signal is ambiguous: an OFFLINE PC could mean the PC is
  down, the network is down, or the monitor itself is blind. A
  self-health indicator ("monitor sees X/Y targets, last sweep N sec
  ago") would help disambiguate during incidents — currently missing.

## Perf events (Diagnostics-Performance channel)

Implemented in:
- `apps/server/src/services/perf-collector.ts`
- `apps/server/src/routes/perf-events.ts`
- `apps/server/migrations/016_perf_events.sql`
- `apps/desktop/src/pages/PerfPage.tsx`

Source channel: `Microsoft-Windows-Diagnostics-Performance/Operational`,
enabled by default on Windows 10/11 (off by default on Server SKU, see below).
The collector pulls slow-event records via `Get-WinEvent -ComputerName ...`
(same RPC path as eventlog collector — needs Event Log Readers + RPC).
EventData is parsed from XML to extract `TotalTime`, `DegradationTime`,
`Name`, `FriendlyName`.

Cold-start window: configurable via `perf.cold_start_days` setting (default
30). Workstations are typically rebooted infrequently — events are sparse —
so a short window risks missing the previous reboot's events. After the first
successful sweep per PC, subsequent runs go incrementally since
`MAX(time_created)` for that computer.

Event ID ranges:
- 100–199 = boot (101 app-caused, 102 driver, 103 service, 108/109 slow service/device, 150 degradation)
- 200–299 = shutdown
- 300–399 = standby
- 400–499 = resume

Limitations:
- Not a continuous CPU graph — only discrete slow-event records when Windows
  itself flagged them as slow. Default channel retention is small (~1 MB ring
  buffer), so we sweep into SQL to preserve history.
- "Slow" threshold is Windows' opinion, not configurable.
- **Channel is disabled by default on Windows Server SKU.** Get-WinEvent
  on a disabled channel returns `"There is not an event log on the X
  computer that matches"`. The collector matches this pattern and
  classifies it as `channel-disabled` (separate counter, not a failure)
  with no per-PC noise — one aggregate count at end of run. To enable
  across the server fleet, push a GPO computer-startup script:
  `wevtutil sl Microsoft-Windows-Diagnostics-Performance/Operational /e:true`.

Setting key: `checks.run_perf` (default `true`).
